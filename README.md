# DSA in JavaScript

Welcome — this repository is a personal collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript. It's designed to help you learn, practice, and track progress while solving common algorithmic problems.

**Goals:**
- **Learn:** Implement core data structures and algorithms in plain JavaScript.
- **Practice:** Solve problems from easy → hard and compare approaches.
- **Prepare:** Get ready for interviews and coding contests.

**Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v14+) installed locally
- Basic JavaScript knowledge (ES6+)

**Repository Structure**
- `1-JsEssentials/` : Foundation files, utilities, language-specific notes.
- (future folders) `2-DataStructures/`, `3-Algorithms/`, `4-ProblemSets/` — organized by topic and difficulty.

Getting started
- Clone the repo:

```
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd DSAInJS
```

- Run an example file with Node:

```
node 1-JsEssentials/example.js
```

Coding conventions
- Use clear folder names for topics (e.g., `arrays`, `trees`, `graphs`).
- File names: `NN-topic-name.js` where `NN` is a two-digit problem number or order.
- Export plain functions or classes so examples can be imported or run by Node.
- Add a short comment header to each file describing the problem and complexity.

Study plan (suggested)
- Week 1: JS essentials, Big-O notation, arrays & strings.
- Week 2: Linked lists, stacks, queues, hashing.
- Week 3: Trees (BST), recursion, basic DFS/BFS.
- Week 4: Graphs, shortest paths, dynamic programming basics.
- Ongoing: Regular problem-solving (LeetCode, HackerRank), timed mock interviews.

Practice tips
- Start by writing a brute-force solution, then iterate toward optimizations.
- Add notes about time and space complexity in each solution file.
- Write small examples and edge-case tests alongside each implementation.

Contributing
- Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/<topic>-<short-desc>`
- Add your implementation under an appropriate folder.
- Follow file naming conventions and include a short description at the top of the file.
- Open a pull request describing the problem, approach, and complexity.

Extras & next steps
- Add a `package.json` and small test harness (e.g., using `node` scripts or a test runner).
- Add a table of contents or index file mapping topics → files.

---
If you'd like, I can:
- add a `package.json` and simple test runner,
- scaffold topic folders like `2-DataStructures`, or
- generate an index/TOC automatically.
Tell me which next step you want.
